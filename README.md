# Framework of Active Semi-Supervised Learning

The Framework of Active Semi-Supervised Learning (FASSL) includes a new active learning strategy for biological context. An extensive experimental evaluation was performed, comparing our proposals with state-of-the-art works and different supervised and semi-supervised classifiers. From the obtained results we can observe the benefits of our proposal, which allows the classifier achieve higher acuracies more quickly with a reduced number of annotated samples. The selection criterion adopted by our learning strategy, based on diversity and uncertainty, enables the prioritization of the most informative boundary samples, minimizing the specialist annotation effort and the learning cycle.
